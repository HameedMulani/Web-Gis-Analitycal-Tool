# Web-GIS-Analytical-Tool
### Objectives
- In this project, we are developing a Web Application, in which users can input data in the form of files. 
- File formats: 
 	- CSV file.
 	- geoJson file.
- Users can Plot Markers and polygons to the map.
- We can find the location of nearby landmarks.

### Problem Statement
1. Complex Analytical Software in the market for analysing the Geographical data.
2. Difficult navigation functionality that cannot be used by new users.
3. No Open Source Web based application available.
4. Installations and configurations are required for Mapping, Analysing and reviewing spatial data.  

### Plans Ahead
- We’ll add the feature of dynamic/runtime map analyzing techniques such as buffer, distance calculation and brief summary of desired area.
- More types of data files can be inserted into map for visualization.
- User can save their work and can continue next time from where they left.

### Technology Used
- JavaScript 
- LeafLet for Mapping
- PHP
- PostgreSQL
- GeoServer Maps
